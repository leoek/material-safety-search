Possible fields
- Must pointer to the file (e.g. 'bcbdx.txt') be included?
Use cases:
- Find specific datasheet (exact) vs. find some datasheet of chemical or ingredient of product (fast in emergency)
- search for multiple chemicals to find product with them all (Type in ingredients on bottle)
- 'disposal/storage of xyz'

1.) Find product (and its MSDS)
2.) Find specific information in its MSDS
e.g. 'hydroflouric acid spilled' should point to 'Accidental Release Measures' on corresponding MSDS
-> Finding MSDS is rather easy (when not in emergency just type in NIIN or similar ID)
-> Aid in finding (suggestions, interactive exploration), Point to measures and procedures (e.g. in emergency situation)

Ways of finding an MSDS:
- type in an exact identifier (NIIN, productID?) -> Regex to find if identifier was entered & show MSDS directly
- search for product name, explore results
- search for company name, explore products
- search for CAS, show products containing that chemical

Exploration possibilities:
- limit search by clicking buttons (company names, more concrete chemical names, category buttons (first aid, storage, etc.))
- show other products with same chemicals / measures / procedures / ...

- links to pubchem.org

To Do:
- create sample structure of MSDS
